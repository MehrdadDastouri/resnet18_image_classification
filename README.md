# Image Classification with Pre-trained ResNet18

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained ResNet18 model from PyTorch's torchvision library to classify images. The model has been trained on ImageNet, and the input image is preprocessed accordingly.

## Features
- Loads a pre-trained ResNet18 model.
- Preprocesses an image to match the input requirements of the model.
- Uses the model to predict the class of the image.
- Retrieves and displays the corresponding class label from ImageNet.
